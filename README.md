Displays the workout day (Pull Day, Push Day, Leg Day, Rest Day), inline, on lockscreen, based on the day of the week. Supports inline lockscreen, small, medium, and large widgets. 

Inlcudes stopwatch. Any edits made to a workout will be saved for the next day (if you edit Pull Day on Monday, it will be saved on Thursday as well). Widgets are refreshed when the save button is pressed in settings, saving the new workout (Only really significant for large widget that displays the workout of the day).
